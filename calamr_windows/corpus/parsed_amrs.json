Of the 12,000 two-year children studied, those who took antibiotics in the first six-months of life had a higher likelihood of being overweight. 4-5 years old in England are overweight or obese leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents obesity babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers a large scale study has found the finish research compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotics prescription. Babies who are given antibiotics at six months of age are more likely to be overweight as toddlers. A third of children who are ten to eleven years of age are overweight. Boys have more probability of being obese due to antibiotics. A large scale study has shown that babies given antibiotics within their first six months are likely to be overweight toddlers. A third of all 10-11 year olds qualify as overweight and obsese, leading to concerns about their future health.
